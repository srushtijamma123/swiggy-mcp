# **Late Delivery Policy**

At **Swiggy**, we strive to ensure your food is delivered within the estimated time. However, delays may occasionally happen due to factors beyond our control. This Late Delivery Policy explains when you may be eligible for compensation and how such cases are handled.

---

## **1. What Counts as a Late Delivery?**

A delivery is considered **late** when:

* The order is delivered **after the estimated delivery time** shown in the app.
* The delay is caused by Swiggy’s operations or the restaurant, not by:

  * Incorrect address
  * Unreachable customer
  * Severe weather
  * Traffic restrictions or emergencies

---

## **2. When You Are Eligible for Compensation**

You may receive compensation in the following cases:

### **a. Significant Delivery Delays**

You may be eligible for a **refund, discount coupon, or Swiggy Money credit** if:

* The delivery partner takes unusually long to deliver, and
* The delay is verified as avoidable.

### **b. Food Quality Impact Due to Delay**

Compensation may be offered if:

* The food arrives cold, soggy, or spoiled **specifically because of a long delay**.

### **c. Delivery Time Promises**

If Swiggy offers a **"Guaranteed Delivery Time"** for a specific order, and the promise is not met, you may receive:

* An instant coupon
* Swiggy Money credit
* Partial refund (depending on the offer)

---

## **3. Non-Compensable Situations**

Swiggy will **not** provide compensation in the following cases:

* Incorrect or incomplete address entered by customer

* Customer unreachable despite multiple contact attempts

* Delays caused by:

  * Rain or extreme weather
  * Traffic jams or roadblocks
  * Public events, festivals, political rallies
  * High demand/surge conditions

* Minor timing differences (e.g., 5–10 minutes delay)

1. Open **Swiggy App → Help**
2. Select the delayed **Order**
